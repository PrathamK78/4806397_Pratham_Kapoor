What is Version Control?
    Version control systems are tools that manage changes made to files and directories in a 
    project. They allow you to keep track of what you did when, undo any changes you decide 
    you don't want, and collaborate at scale with others. This cheat sheet focuses on one of the 
    most popular one, Git.
